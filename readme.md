# ARCH
ARCH is a tool for documentation of Cisco devices(mainly IOS-XE routers).   

ARCH was a tool written for SecureCRT because that was the only way to use python for network automation.    
 

The tool has three standalone parts.  

## Part 1: Geahter informatsion

Using Netmiko(Alternativ):    

## Part 2: Pharse informasion and create a csv file  
Using: SecureCRT or Python  

## Part 3: Create an excel file from each CSV file   
Using:  Python (Not SecureCRT combability jet)  


ARCH  is still under development, so bugs and changes can occur
